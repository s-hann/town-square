## How to run this project
To run this project, type `flutter run` in the terminal or use the launch configuration in VSCode.\
_\*Town Square is already tested and works on iOS, Android, and Web._

## Assumptions
1. All buttons should work. Although for now, it’s just showing a "Coming soon" message.
2. The only functionalities I need to implement in this task are the filter task and the activity card (including loading and error card state).
3. Since there is no information on which case the error card will be shown, I assume the error state means the event has started thus the user can no longer join the event.
4. The date on the upper side of the page is based on the current date, not hardcoded.


## What can I improve with more time
1. Extract duplicate design into reusable widgets.
2. Complete the app theme and typography codebase to create a cleaner code and easier maintenance.
3. Improve the data and domain layer (it will be useful to integrate data from the server).
4. Implement a dark theme.
